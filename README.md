# Running Skyway Interview Code Test Locally

# Start the react application
```sh
npm start
```

# The local server runs on a json server mock backend
# Start the local server
```sh
node server.js
```

# Viewing app from deployment
https://tmskywayinterview.netlify.app

```sh
node server.js
```

# I did not impliment serverless netlify functions.
# Therefore even when running remotely
# You still need to start the server locally for now.
